# 📈 Quantitative-Analysis-of-Stock-Market-using-Python
This project presents a detailed quantitative analysis of stock market trends and behaviors using Python.
It focuses on four major stocks: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Netflix (NFLX) — covering their historical price trends, volatility, and correlation patterns.

By combining descriptive statistics, volatility modeling, correlation analysis, and time-series visualization, this project helps extract actionable insights about stock market behavior.

## 🚀 Key Features
  - 📊 Volatility Analysis: Identify which stocks exhibit the most and least price fluctuation.

  - 🔗 Correlation Matrix: Understand how different stocks move relative to each other.

  - 📈 Time-Series Visualization: Plot historical stock trends to observe performance over time.

  - 📉 Statistical Summary: Generate insights from descriptive statistics like mean, median, std deviation.

  - 🖼️ Interactive Visuals: Use Plotly for attractive and informative charts.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
  - Python 3.x
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - NumPy for numerical operations
  - Plotly for interactive data visualization
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional) for additional plots
  - Jupyter Notebook for analysis workflow

## 📊 Results & Insights
1. NFLX was found to be the most volatile stock (std deviation ≈ 18.55).
2. GOOG had the least volatility, indicating price stability (std deviation ≈ 6.28).
3. AAPL ↔ MSFT demonstrated a strong positive correlation (0.95), suggesting synchronous movement.
4. AAPL ↔ GOOG also had high correlation (0.90).
5. NFLX showed minimal correlation with other stocks — highlighting its independent behavior.
6. Trend visualizations provided deeper understanding of stock price evolution during the selected period.
